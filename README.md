### - Inspired by LF
### - Target: <1000 LoC with all my required functionalities

#### Known Issues and Needed Features (notes to myself):

- What is the small white text beside the "1. Databases - ~" folder that says "ai", on selecting first video, this changes to "ha", second video "s", third video "ai", 4th video "am" and so on... as shown in the attached image. Is the video text overflowing back somehow? Is this a rendering issue? Fix whatever issue this is. No overflow should happen whatsoever. Everything should be absolutely neatly and cleanly organized.

- Also, when I scroll up, I see the history of my file navigation in this session, this shouldn't be shown to me, it should always clear screen, no history whatsoever. 

- If the pwd in the header in PS1 is not able to fit the full pwd in the screen, it shouldn't just cut-out, it should adjust so that

"shashank@MacBook:~/Documents/GATE/Lectures/9. DBMS/1. E-R Model and Relational Model/1. Databases -  introduction/1. Appli"

should become

"shashank@MacBook:~/D/G/L/1/1/1. Mathematical Logic/1.Logic- Propositional and Predicate/1.Why study Logic-gammabhaiya.mp4"

- Which means the starting folders in pwd should be replaced by single starting letters (in order, which means do it for first folder if pwd still doesn't fit the screen then do it for the second folder if it still doesn't fit then third and so on...) of their starting words in order for the whole pwd to fit the full screen

- Slightly dim the colors of the preview pane, it should be the same color but it should be slightly dimmed to indicate it is not the current pane

- lf config file, all colors for cut, paste and so on...
  
- minimal c code, below 1000 loc, give to claude and analyze efficiency
